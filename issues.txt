//primary
1. scene crashing from removing fruit object from scene on collide
2. scene crashing from trying to disable dynamic-body on collide
3. cant disable physics collider
4. seems like fps is not controllable? so timing variations
5. cant adjust superhands collider (not sure what is determining the boundary)

//secondary
5. thumbstick detection is non-continuous
6. grab detection is very fidgety (triggers and untriggers randomly)
